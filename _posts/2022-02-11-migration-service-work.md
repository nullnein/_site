Issues with the story:

- Focus unclear: Migration or Refugees in Germany?
- Research necessary on: 
  - Food Delivery and Migration (Statistics?)
  - Amazon and work perspective
  - entry-level service industry and job security
- O-Töne
  - Balance: Ask for comment
    - Amazon
    - Gorillaz
  - Union/Initiative
  - A rider themselves

»Of course I support a fellow Indian worker in retaining their job,« says my friend Shabnam after I ask her about ordering on Gorillaz. Single-handedly she rebuffs shallow critique about ordering at the food delivery. 

It is a late evening and being a great host she just virtually went to the kiosk and have somebody bring two more cases of beer. I ask her whether she had already tipped and of course she had, on the app. Me, still feeling guilty that I didn't contribute to this evening materially and feeling guilty that a migrant worker has to work with Gorillaz, I run downstairs so and tip again.

Now with a fresh beer in hand, we keep discussing the business model Gorillaz and Flink. Shabnam says, the jobs are great for Indian students in Germany. Because there aren't that many entry level jobs that don't require great command of German.

Delivery riding requires no German skills and can be done part-time, so studying is still possible. At the same time students from India often receive have some support from home, so a job like with Gorillaz may suffice.

For others, it isn't enough. Pedro* spent years wrangling with the German migration system. He is seeking asylum for political prosecution in Venezuela. He has a masters degree and work experience in tech so getting a job was actually simple for him in Germany. Nevertheless, he spent [how many?] months in a refugee camp and later refugee accomodation in Leipzig.

After you are officially allowed to stay in the country without having your asylum fully approved, German authorities push refugees to find work, Pedro says. Many now find it with Amazon. Their warehouses offer entry level jobs, with no German required and full time positions. But, they offer little future.

But often refugees never enter the official workforce but stay within illicit employment. Pedro noticed cars of construction companies parked outside his refugee accomodation outside Leipzig quickly. »They approach refugees and ask them to work doing basic construction work [which kind?]. They promise 15 to 20 Euros an hour,« says Pedro. [This info should come from somebody else, while Pedro should add emotion: *15 to 20 Euros is great money if you compare it to how much you can make in other jobs.*

Now, Pedro has friends who sit on piles of cash. Since the money was earned illegally, it cannot be used to rent an appartment or sent home to support their family. »This one friend of mine lives with his employer, they do scaffolding, and his rent is simply deducted from his illicit wage«

Many refugees in vulnerable position turn to prostitution however. »I know an albino person who tends to sexual kinks of a whole range of clients,« says Pedro.
