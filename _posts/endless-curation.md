# Endless Curation

It was my birthday and among the words I received, I especially cherished one specific present. Giving an unsolicited gift is a leap of faith. You never know how it will be received. At best it brings unexpected joy, at worst it is a waste of money, time, and hurt feelings of not being understood. But the book I got came from a mix of listening and trust which made it a pretty safe bet as a present.

## The story of a gift

The book is Yanis Varoufakis' »Another Now« which spells out the economic stage for a possible progressive future. And it starrs the inventor Costa who listenes quite closely to his alter ego in an alternative universe, explaining to him how capitalism can be undone. 

The story of how I assume this gift came about is as follows: I had been invited and trusted to do for two weeks whatever me and my team felt was the right thing to do. All basic needs were taken care of. One could say for these two weeks we lived a real utopia. It was our team and a total of twenty young people who were much more left-leaning than election results suggest. And there was a structural element of the organizers of these two weeks who simply said: »Come, do as you please. We are here for you.«

I have never been in a similar situation before. A situation where I was completely taken care of and just trusted to *do*, no strings attached. 

We all arrived at theses special two weeks and took some time to click and get to know each other. Early conversations could entail questions and suggestions on our individual group project since they were obvious points of departure.

As our project was about explaining stuff related to economics, Simon suggested to us we check out Yanis Varoufakis' work and there was a brief exchange on the Greek economist. When some days later my team wanted to gift me something, they had to come up with something they could easily produce or accquire in a strange city while remaining within a budget. 

Given these constraints, a book seemed obvious. But which book do you give to a guy who pretends to have read some but you're not sure which. The obvious choice was Varoufakis' book which came out recently and I clearly had some interest in his work.

So there was certain listening into the conversation with Simon entailed. This listening extended beyond Simon, however. It was about listening to me as well. How did I engage when the name Varoufakis came up? What were my general feelings about reading?

When I received the book, I felt heard, listened to, even *seen* as the person I am.

But, there is a layer underneath this effort of listening. There has to be trust. Trust into the fact that Simon has something to say. Sure, in this case there had been validation. But there was trust that Simon's words would be great to hear even when we just told him cordially about what we were up to.

## A VC of trust and listening

Given the capacities of our economies we could grant people money to do stuff all the time. Thechnically, this is what Venture Capital (VC) does: A whole lot of very rich people pour money into a trust and this trust disperses it to a group of start-ups. The start-ups are all put into a pressure cooker of money and "business advice". Then these start-ups try to make profits. At the last stage the start-up is sold to the public by offering it to bidders at the stock market. The VCs obviously intend to make money from selling the start-up to the public. This is essentially the model how the future of capitalism is shaped from a business perspective at the moment. 

Its a great model because people want to make something and they get shitloads of money to get it done.

It is also a great model because there is so much competition and pressure that the involved start-ups go way beyond their limits to outperform each other. This model has allowed to transform our societies away from trusted relationships between people towards fragile human-machine interfaces.

However, the model has some flaws. The obvious may be increased inequality and throttled innovation but those are just capitalism. 

The problem is, the model is profit, not trust driven. When deciding which start-ups to invest in, VCs gague how likely it is that this particular firm will turn a seizable profit in the future. 

For understandable reasons, VCs like to see profit. Thus, they prediscribe a very, very specific outcome for all their start-ups. While start-ups can do what they like, the output is neccessarily profit. 

This was different at the special weeks I was allowed to attend, named 1/2/8 hereafter. We each may have applied with individual projects to attend. But the organizers simply put trust in the people who would come. Trust, that the time at 1/2/8 would be worthwhile for everyone involved, nevermind outcomes.

The organizers took a leap of faith with the teams they invited. And I for one experienced the time there as a gift.

## Listening requires time thus 1/2/8 shouldn't be over

The important thing is, that the trust the organizers put into us oozed into me and our team, not least when we talked to Simon. If he were trusted to be here just as us, surely we should tell him about our endeavour and see what he'd suggest. He wasn't a contender, surely he just ment well. If Simon recommended Varoufakis, surely the greek economist be worth to pick as a gift to one of the team members.

The process of the gift for my birthday marks some points of crystalization of an otherwise endless process of curation. Ideas floated around the organizers for a while, were captured and ordered, put out into the world, again extended, captured, and ordered and then a horde of 20 people arrived to extend, capture, and order thought. None of this would have been possible without trust and or without listening.

From a perspective of grassroots activism I cherished to see what happened throughout the two weeks with all the participants present. Sub-groups formed. Gossip developed. Organizing happened. And after two weeks we started having an honest conversation about why we spent time together. 

If 1/2/8 were about the grand questions of our time and how to approach them, what happened at 1/2/8 could be a gift to these questions.

If we live in a time of alienation and profit-driven competition, we could counter with trust. Trust in the thought that everybody around us has something to say. But then, we needed to listen closely, ask repeatedly and put more trust into the conversation, even if it stalls for a moment.

If 1/2/8 is about fostering trust and listening closely, 1/2/8 cannot be over. Because the trust has just begun to crystalize.
