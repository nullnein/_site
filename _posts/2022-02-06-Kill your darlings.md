title: Kill your darlings
abstract: A week of radio workshops
---

This week brought a crash course into radio. While killing your darlings is important to all work, I'll mention it here because it hit me here so strongly.

## The first piece

I did two pieces. One on how DW protects their journalists in Germany, with violence against [members of the press increasing](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/journalismus-pressefreiheit-corona-leugner-querdenker-1.5518391?reduced=true), as also NGOs report. For this piece, I interviewed DW's reporter on right-wing movements who by coincidence also interviewed me during the DW assessment center. I messed up the piece in two ways: I spoke my narration too slowly and then tried to cover it by putting dramatic music. Major learning: Practice speech (more below). 

## The second piece

Then I met Klaus, who runs a currywurst bude just accross from DW, on the Rhine. Beautiful interview, great partner, would like to get back to him again.

Major learnings:

- Take your time when getting to a scenery. Have a cup of coffee first, be patient, chill and then figure out where to to the interview.
- Hold the microphone really close, otherwise the voice is too low and if you boost the volume there will be background.
- Ask them to turn off music to have a quite place for a chat.
- Chat to them first, then turn on the machine.
- Kill your darlings: I had so many nice quotes but having less in the piece would have been more.

## Overall learnings

- Anmoderation/Narration
  - Don't reveal too much in the Anmoderation, make listeners curious; But use Anmoderation to place the story.
  - Write teaser/Anmoderation first. Then you will know where you're going.
  - See Anmoderation and Narration as one unit.
  - Anmoderation: Put the listener on the track for the first part of the piece
  - Cappuchino-Effect: Tell your story over a cup of coffee.
  - Your hook needs to be close to your agenda.
  - Structuring Narration: Use simple stuff: Sleep, eat, toilet but be aware if the simple structure fits your story
  - Push background info into the middle of your story, be scenic.
  - Use your experts to give examples, provide pictures. Put explanation into your narration.
  - Be aware to portray your people well. Even if they use Phrasen that may portray them, don't put them, it doesn't do them justice.
- Production:
  - Have subjects help you: Quiet place, turn off music
  - Before you go out: Check of your subject can answer your driving question.
  - If you talk to a customer/visitor, make sure their statement fits/enhances the story
  - Music works to show something: I.e. cliché music (hip-hop) can introduce a scenery (young people) but is context/audience specific
  - Always record a lot of long ambience on the ground
  - Atmo: Is it clear what the Atmo is? Is it aggressive or drunk people yelling? Which picture do you see when hearing the sound?
- Technical stuff
  - The auto-level can boost background noise in short breaks of speech
  - Clean »ahs« from soundbites
  - Check level of recorded voice visually on recording device
  - Check level of ambience with your ears through headphones



## Sinnverstehendes Lesen

Andreas nennt ordentliches Sprechen für's Radio »Sinnverstehendes Lesen«, das Internet verortet den Begriff in der Grundschule.

Wichtige Punkte:

- Text nicht in Grammatik unterteilen, sondern in Sinnabschnitte
- Text durchgehen und markieren:
  - Pausen
  - Binden
  - Stimme Runter
- Immer ganz einatmen, dann kommt man auch weit
- Geschwindigkeit: Wie mit einem normalen Menschen reden
- Fragezeichen: Stimme hoch, Betonung auf Fragewort
- Deutsche Bühnenhochlautung: 
  - Endung -ig: König wird Könich
  - Endung -en: Essen wird Essn
  - Im Zweifel: Aussprachedatenbank
