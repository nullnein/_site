- The Third Pole is a publication on issues related to the climate crisis with a special focus on Global South countries. They make strong use of linking to scientific papers and interlinking other reporting.
  - I was especially taken by their [report on natural calamities causing mental health issues in northern Pakistan](https://www.thethirdpole.net/en/climate/climate-disasters-trigger-mental-health-crisis-in-pakistans-mountains/). Apparently, mental health effects of the climate crisis are understudied.
  - They make wide use of linking to scientific papers, i.e. [this one](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/poleco/v56y2019icp151-164.html) that argues for causal link between higher female representation in national parliaments and stronger climate policy outcomes.
- Reuters [produced a clever and simple explainer](https://graphics.reuters.com/TONGA-VOLCANO/lgpdwjyqbvo/) on the Tonga erruption using a gif of the ash plume overlaid onto various landmasses for context.
- [Fahrrad-Tools](https://fahrrad-tools.de/tube.html) is a nice way to make knowledge on bicycle lables accessible: It searches a database of matches the label on your tire if you wonder which tube or tire fits.
