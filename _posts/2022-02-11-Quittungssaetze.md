A week of interview-training, mostly 3:30 live-interviews for radio or TV. One day of vox pops and focus, focus, focus.

## Goal

- Which type?
  - Information *about the matter* (with an expert)
  - Profile *about the person*
  - Opinion on a topic
- Driving Question
- Nine-Letter headline
  - Found this very helpful to define where I want to go with the interview, what is it supposed to bring?
  - Define narrow and sigular focus (do you have only one focus?!)

## Preparation

- Pre-Chat

  - Define focus
  - Possibly tell about first question
  - Tell them to keep it short and simple, no jargon
  - Possibly get a voice message w/ their name pronounciation
  - How do they want to be introduced?
  - Why are they relevant for the topic?
  - How do they look/sound? (More headspace is better than too little)
- First Question

  - Depends, may give too much away, can set the tone
  - Politician: Be provocative, then follow up
  - Expert: Don't provoke them, they talk too long and you can't be rude
  - Possibly just let them describe:
    - How big is this?
    - What are the parts of this?
    - Give us an example
  - Headline as first question: May be punchy but may take away the whole story; May allow them to stray too much
- Structure

  - Micro-Macro-Micro-other Macro is super nice
  - Possibly establish context with first question: »How does it feel to be a black man in Brazil?«
  - Most important thing front and center (significance)
- Moderation

  - Erklärmoderation, if a lot has to be explained
  - Try not to have wikipedia-moderation, narrate like in a bar
  - Keep moderation very close to the topic
  - Make clear why you're talking to this guest
- Abmoderation
  - Write it beforehand
  - If nothing else: »Does the central bank still have power to deal with inflation. I talked about this with ECB spokesperson XYZ«
  - Great, if you can summarize what was discussed
  - No additional information in the Abmoderation (may be cut out)

- Helpers:
  - Write down list of possible interruptions: »Do you mean...«, »Why do you say that exactly?«, »To be clear...« (great one)
  - Write down what answers may be
  - If question isn't answered, ask again


## How to conduct

- Questions:
  - Never do bundled questions
  - Ask open questions but frame them with examples: »How are middle classes in turkey suffering from inflation, for exampe families in their housing situations?«
  - Pointed questions are great
- Inserts
  - No Quittungssätze (»interessant«, »great«, »really«)
  - Floskeln vermeiden: »In the studio with me...«, »Ich würde dich gern fragen...« (Could be different in very personal interview)
  - Add context also with obvious stuff: »Why are protests impossible right now?«
  - Interrupt for clarifications
  - Long replies: Add signposts to take control and add orientation. »Do I understand correctly that...«, »You said this and this what about [next question]«
- Don't wobble with your body. Any nodding that you'd normally do is fine
- Wear clothes with contrasts, not too dark, not too small patterns

## Voxes

- Ask personal questions
  - How do you feel about...?
  - How does ... affect you?
- If you ask »what should be done about...«, people want to be correct and you get political answers
- Keep asking the same questions but keep digging
- Edit to have people who bring new perspectives
- You want "characters"
- Be aware: Voices may blend into each other; It's a problem
- You can use the same person several times if they're great
- Dramaturgie: Strong-Middle-Strong
- Complex topic:
  - Repeat opinions to let them sink in
  - Be aware: Is everyone answering the same question? Otherwise you may have a lot of confusion.
