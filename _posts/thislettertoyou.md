What is it like to have a relationship and a love-affair at the same time? What is a relationship and what is a love-affair? What is a relationship? What is a love-affair? Is it a love-affair?

Writing this letter was a letter of affection. It was excitement and it was important. It was important to get it out of the sytem, it was important to be precise and it was especially important to have it well written. I was happy with myself when the words flowed nicely. I was pleased to have it spelled out and I was particularly pleased when some thoughts just clicked.

I wanted to show you these thoughts. I wanted to show you how I think abou you. And ever since I wrote this letter my thoughts keep drifting to you. My thoughts keep clanging onto your narrow shoulders, your cheekish hair, your nimble neck.

I was off you. I was off this drug of thinking of you and seeing you inside my eyes. And now you're back. Back in my morning, evening, when my mind gets to wander, you step into my frame again.

Time had washed you to the edges of my perception and I pulled you back, not knowing what I was doing.

I hadn't expected this. No, I hadn't expected to be drawn back like this. But this letter says it all, doesn't it. It says: Let's be close, open up, I show you mine, you show me yours, come here, be close, be held, hold me, have me. It tries to also say: I know what I feel, I know what I want, where I am, where I want to be, how it works, where we are, what we are, it is distanced and doesn't show it directly. It is so clear to hide the emotions, the drama, what's inside me. It hides it all because I hadn't known how much it would draw me in.

And here we are now. Me waiting for your reply, you waiting for your reply and there is nothing I particularly want.

It could be a game and it could just be messing with emotion. But what kind of game would that be? No rules, no goal, it would be timepass.

But then, what is this, why is this? What are we doing here and why? Writing to you, I was in a rush of excitement.

If this isn't going anywhere, why are we doing this? Because its fun? Because we feel like it? Because we like to experiment with our feelings and just see what happens? Is gambling fun? What are we gambling with here?

What is this connection I feel towards you? I feel understood. I feel like I want to tell you. I want to know your thoughts, see you smile, feel your body. I'm drawn to you. And I shouldn't say I'm not.
